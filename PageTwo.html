			<h1>Academic Route</h1>
			<p>I was not accepted to the Informatics department the first time around but I am determined to pursue the field regardless. I have decided to retake a couple classes and take INFO 343 to better prepare me for the application process next year. I am hopeful that I can find an experience I have had to be able and approach it through a technical Informatics lense so I will be much better off. I think that is something that my application greatly lacked the first time. If I can do that along with doing well in my INFO 343 class I am confident in my ability to get accepted. I have great leadership experience and decent grades and I believe that if I can get some industry experience I will complete the trifecta of qualifications for admission.</p>

			<h1>Binary Converter</h1>
			<p>This is a webpage I made with my knowledge of HTML and CSS that I learned in INFO 100 freshmen spring quarter with Katherine Diebel as my teacher. It's pretty basic and converts numbers to and from their 8-bit binary representation. The scripting approach is not as streamlined as it could be but works regardless and can accept numbers or binary sequences of any length. Give it a try <a href="http://students.washington.edu/budnir/Binary/Converter.html">here!</a></p>

			<h1>Sudoku</h1>
			<p>This <a href="http://students.washington.edu/budnir/Sudoku.html">webpage</a> is one that I have been working on recently over the summer while flying to various locations. My original plan, given enough time, was to have this site be able to solve any difficulty puzzle. I was going to have the solve method there to act a sort of master copy to refer to when checking the clients inputs and to provide feedback as to correct or incorrect inputs. I ended up adding a button for the solve function anyways not only for debuggin but also just for fun and flash. I use a a series of strings, and text boxes to solve the puzzles. Although this is a very basic approach it works all the same. There are many things I would do to improve this further. I  would make the solve formula recursive to eliminate excessive repetition. If you notice on the site you have to click the solve button three times to solve the easy puzzle. If recursion was added the button would have to be used once and would iterate through until the puzzle is finished. However given my limited knowledge of javascript I had to use some more primitive strategies. Warning: this project is still in beta testing phase. Algorithms are not complete and are not optimized.</p>
