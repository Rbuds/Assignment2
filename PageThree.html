			<p>I decided to join a Fraternity my freshmen year and have never regretted doing so. I have had a great environment to not only meet people and make connections, but to also experience a side of the college life that I find invaluable. I sometimes refer to my decision to joining as being the best mistake I have ever made. A fraternity is without a doubt a chaotic and rowdy environment for a student at such a difficult school. I was, however, lucky to join a house that is extremely successful and nuturing towards academics. We are consistently ranked in the top five houses on campus and continue to put academics as our first and foremost priority. My involvement in this setting is something I really wanted to get out of my time there. I have been in multiple leadership positions in the house that have taught me a lot about how to work with and motivate your co-workers. Positions held:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Food Liaison</li>
				<li>Judicial Board</li>
				<li>Assistant Facilities Manager</li>
				<li>Facilities Manager</li>
			</ul>
			<p>More than that others I have learned a tremendous amount from being the facilities manager. As the, for all intensive purposes, land lord I have learned to deal with authority figures whether it be the police, fire department, or the alumni board. I have also had a great amount of responsibility as the facilties manager. There is a certain level of maturity and discretion I have aquired from having a master key to everyones room. Apart from the things I personally do in the position I manage many other positions in the house as part of an umbrella management strategy. I oversee our full-time contractors, full-time chef, assistant facilities manager, and cleaning force. This particular part of the job has taught me a lot about employee empowerment and planning. Whether I am delegating projects to my assistant, reviewing the food service with our chef, or hiring and firing contractors to complete my project lists I am always working to create professional relationships with them and anyone the process may put me in contact with.</p>
